Git 
Git is the version controlling system or source code mangement code. 
it helps to versioning the codes to identify or issue.
It has 
local version control system
CVCS-Centralized Version control system
Distributed version control system

Locan means, it like laptop

CVCS
It have one common repository, all the developer put commit and update in the repository,
disadvantage: slow latency, Dependency of contiunes internet

Distributed version control system

we can commit and update in the local repo, after confirming only we will push the code to remote repo

Branching 
It's nonthing, for master there will be in branch it's called branching..!
In the real time most of the time commit will not added in master, it will mostly added in branching.
every thing is done, Maker and checker will approve the code after the checking, then only we will commit to master.
Master is only accessable by senior person or admin person

soomth Mergering
After Developer put and code and get approved from maker and checker, then it's need to be merge to master branch. 
before mergering make sure we checkout to master branch because merge need to do in master branch only.

after merging, we can see both the master initial code and devloper code will merge into single with out any conflits. 

This is called smooth merging

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
Conflict Merge

If some developer directly access the master and put some worng codes however in the meantime another developer put codes in dev and get approval and tried to merge with master. 
at this time, it will through erros as merge conflict, because already one commit has been updated via master.

For this we need to install merge conflict tools to arrest the issue.
